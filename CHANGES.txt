Changelog
=========

1.1b1 - Unreleased
------------------

- Fixed the IIDNormalizer to generate valid CSS ID or Python variable names as
  specified in its docstring. It no longer tries to preserve filename
  extensions. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9708.
  [hannosch]

- Added a new explicit base normalizer for Thai, as the Unidecode based
  transliteration isn't good enough.
  [hannosch]

- Added new specific normalizer for Japanese, which avoids the Unidecode based
  transliteration. This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9914.
  [hannosch]

1.1a2 - 2009-12-02
------------------

- Depend on and include ``Unidecode`` based transliterations. These provide
  more meaningful results than unicodedata NFKD normalizations or hex codes.
  [hannosch]

- Added cs-cz combined language code. It solves problem with default language
  on new Plone site creation (Safari/Mac).
  [naro]

- Added missing 'native' descriptions to pt-* combined languages.
  [igbun]

1.1a1 - 2009-04-04
------------------

- Removed the negotiator sub-package, as it hasn't been enabled or used yet.
  The functionality is better placed as a WSGI-middleware.
  [hannosch]

- Register all dependencies in setup.py. Move test dependencies into a
  separate extra to keep the dependencies low so things like the normalizer
  can be used in non-zope contexts.
  [wichert]

1.0.9 - Unreleased
------------------

- Added Romanian language as the language for the .ro TLD. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9152
  [vincentfretin]

1.0.8 - 2009-10-15
------------------

- Added new UNDERSCORE_START_REGEX to the file normalizer. This removes any
  leading underscores from uploaded file names. Objects in Zope cannot start
  with an underscore, so it makes little sense to generate suggested file
  names which cannot work.
  [hannosch]

- Added bulgarian normalizer.
  [vlado]

1.0.7 - 2008-11-05
------------------

- Allow _ as a valid character in file names and URLs. Do not remove # from
  file names. It only has a special meaning for URLs.
  [hannosch, sidnei]

1.0.6 - August 18, 2008
-----------------------

- Added normalization for a French-only character (igature of o and e)
  which isn't part of ISO 8859-1. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7512.
  [dbaty, hannosch]

- Fixed the greek character normalization based on a patch by ggozad.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8308.
  [hannosch]

- Changed the default normalization of characters used in Scandinavian
  languages to meet the most common rules. This is based on a discussion
  with translators from all Scandinavian countries.
  [hannosch]

- Added a subdomain language negotiator (e.g. de.plone.org).
  [stefan]

1.0.5 - May 22, 2008
--------------------

- Added a new max_length argument to the normalize method. This allows you
  to override the default values for the maximum length on a call basis.
  [hannosch, fschulze]

- Added a new MAX_URL_LENGTH constant used by the URL normalizer. It
  defaults to 255.
  [hannosch]

- Added '`' to the list of dangerous chars, which will be removed by the
  url and be replaced with a dash by the file name normalizer now.
  [hannosch, mj]

1.0.4 - April 19, 2008
----------------------

- If a dot was used in a url, the url was not lowercased. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7961.
  [hannosch]

1.0.3 - February 13, 2008
-------------------------

- Updating the flag/language listings. Updating readme to include the flag
  mapping logic. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7441.
  [limi]

- Adding all the Arabic-speaking countries with their respective flags, and
  adding a generic flag to represent Arabic in general (verified to be OK with
  two independent, native residents).
  [limi]

- Added tests for the filename and url request adapters. We have now 100%
  test coverage.
  [hannosch]

- Wrote tests for the locale-aware id normalizer and fixed a bug in it.
  [hannosch]

- Added more tests.
  [hannosch]

- Removed unused and untested 'native' from country information.
  [hannosch]

- Don't allow double quotes in normalized urls.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/764.
  [hannosch]

1.0.2 - November 24, 2007
-------------------------

- Remove those [] brackets from file names as well.
  [hannosch]

- Increase the maximum filename size to 1023 and make it independently
  configurable.
  [hannosch]

1.0.1 - October 7, 2007
-----------------------

- Extend polish normalizer 'dashed L' to L. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6845.
  [hannosch]

  negotiator with similar functionality as PloneLanguageTool. It is not
  enabled by default.
  [hannosch]

- Added the reference to the Faroese flag.
  [deo]

- Remove more punctuation characters as for example using a comma in the
  title results in a not so friendly ID. This closes

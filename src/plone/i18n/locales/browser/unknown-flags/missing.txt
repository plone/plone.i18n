Flags for these countries listed in ISO 3166 are currently missing:

ax - Ã…LAND ISLANDS
cy - CYPRUS
gg - GUERNSEY
gs - SOUTH GEORGIA AND THE SOUTH SANDWICH ISLANDS

The other files in this folder are flags for codes that does not exit in
ISO 3166. Need investigation if they are only misnamed or what they actually
symbolize.
